Game - a competitive activity in which players contend with each other according to a set of rules.


### 1.2 Theory of Rational Choice

No qualitative restriction is placed on the decision-maker's preferences.
	Her rationality lies in the consistency of her actions.


#### 1.2.1 Actions

Theory of Rational Choice consists of two parts:
	a set A consisting of all the actions that, under some circumstances, are available to the decision maker, and a specification of the decision-maker's preferences.

#### 1.2.2 Preferences and payoff functions

For preferences she knows either:
	The preference
	That she is indifferent with the outcome

Payoff function u represents a decision-maker's preferences if, for any actions a in A and b in A,
```Equation
u(a) > u(b) if and only if the decision-maker prefers a to b.
```
 Other names include Preference indicator function and Utility function.

Example of payoff function:
	u(Havana) = 1, u(Paris) = u(Venice) = 0
	or
	u(Havana) = 12, u(Paris) = u(Venice) = 4

u(x_1, x_2) = x<subscript>1</subscript> 

Exercise 5.3 Altruistic preferences:
	Person 1 cares about both her income and Person 2's income.
	u(Income(P1)) = u(2*(Income(P2))):
		(1,4) - P1 prefers P2
		1 + 2 = 3
		(2,1) - P1 prefers P1
		2 +  0.5 = 2.5
		(3,0) - P1 prefers P1
		3 + 0 = 3
		(1, 4) + (2, 1) > (3, 0)

If preference distribution is a = 1, b = 2, c = 300
Then all we know is c > b > a.
We cannot conclude that c is much better than b, and b is only slightly better than a.

Pay off function, if u represents a decision-maker's preferences and v is another payoff function for which:
```Equation
v(a) > v(b) if and only if u(a) > u(b)
```

Exercise 6.1:
	u(a) = 0
	u(b) = 1
	u(c) = 4
	v(a) = -1
	v(b) = 0
	v(c) = 2

u(c) > u(b) > u(a)

Are they also represented by the function v?
v(c) > v(b) > v(a)
Therefor v = u


How about the function w for which:
	w(a) = w(b) = 0
	w(c) = 8

w(c) > w(a) and w(b)
Therefor w does not equal v and u.

1.2.3 The theory of rational choice

Theory of rational choice is - the action chosen by a decision-maker is at least as good, according to her preferences, as every other available action.

In economic theory - the set of available actions is the set of all bundles of goods that the consumer can afford.

Part 1 of the book presents the man models in game theory: a strategic game, an extensive game, and a coalitional game.

Strategic and extensive games focus on the actions of individuals, whereas a coalitional game focuses on the outcomes that can be achieved by groups of individuals.
